# Software Construction Course Project

This project is part of a software construction course. It involves three main tasks:

1. Conducting domain modeling
2. Implementing changes requested during domain modeling
3. Identifying code smells and refactoring

## Task 1 - Conduct Domain Modeling

In this task, we conducted domain modeling for an daily expense system. 
This involved identifying the main entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. 
The domain model serves as a conceptual model of the system and provides a high-level understanding of its major components.

## Task 2 - Implementing Changes Requested During Domain Modeling

During the domain modeling process, several changes were requested. 
These changes were implemented in this task. 
They involved modifying the attributes of some entities, adding new entities, and changing the relationships between entities.

## Task 3 - Code Smell Identification and Refactoring

In this task, we identified several code smells in the existing codebase. 
These included long methods, large classes, and duplicate code. 
We then refactored the code to eliminate these smells, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

## Getting Started
